Nobody likes an addendum.

P.S.? P.P.S. That's where the magic of a penpal's letter comes in. Here's a letter from my cousin Ginny that i recently found. Look at that P.S.

But addendums? No, thank you. An addendum is gonna be bad news. You think you've got it all figured out, and then, oh wait, here's an addendum.

Survivorship Clinic

After my surgery on October 12

Ironman? I've got this thing in my chest called a port. 

Chemotherapy? am i shooting spider webs yet? No. Are my sperm all dead? Maybe? 

Sperm banking is a strange experience. I'll leave it at that. No, I won't. The hospital puts you in a room with a Roku and a porn subscription. I'll leave it at that. No, I won't. After you do the deed, you put your sample cup in a room

Longitudinal data

Diet

Here's an article that my friend sent me. I've also got these cook books?

Good foods:
* leafy greens

Bad foods:

mediterranean foods that my friend Karim would have growing up. "Simple, man" is what he would say. "Simple." Fresh vegetables, hard boiled eggs, etc
