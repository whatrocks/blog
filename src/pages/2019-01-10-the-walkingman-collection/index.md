I've pulled all my [Instagram #walkingman](https://instagram.com/whatrocks) photos into a handy little page. [Check it out](/walkingman). 

~~So long as the Instagram API continues to play nice (no guarantee of that), then [this page](/walkingman) will stay up-to-date as my travels continue.~~

*The Instagram API isn't working anymore, at least not the way that this Gatsby plugin was working. I'll have to work on another way to serve up these little photos.*

I'd love to learn more about who designs each of these little creatures for a given city or country. What's the decision process like? Are they meant to capture the spirit of the people in some way? 

This is a coffee table book waiting to happen.
