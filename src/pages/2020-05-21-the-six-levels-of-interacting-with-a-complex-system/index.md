We recently borrowed our friend's car, and he gave us a few warnings before handing over the keys:

* It takes the *expensive* kind of gas
* The trunk doesn't always open up from the outside
* The dash says the tail-light is out, but it's not
* You'll need to add more oil every 100 miles or so, and it's probably overdue for an oil change anyway

I nodded throughout. Yup, needs prem-o gas. Trunk's weird, okay. Tail-light light, good to know. Oil, yeah, oil's a thing that cars need.

Meanwhile, I caught myself thinking, "Man, he really knows a lot about cars."

I, for one, don't. My dad knows how to take a car apart and put it back together. I know how to get 120 stars in Super Mario 64. Sure, I learned some stuff about cars growing up. I've changed flat tires in a pinch, helped my dad replace brake pads on our monstrous Suburban, sorta payed attention while he changed the oil in Old Blue (his beloved sky blue '85 Blazer).

Fact is, I've never owned a car in my adult life (city-living). For those intermittent and unavoidable road trips, I've been a semi-content customer of Zipcar. 

I haven't ever been forced to face the reality of **learning cars**.

But, sure, I'd like to! In fact, I've been fantasizing lately about getting an old Volkswagon Beetle and tearing it down and rebuilding anew. I was told that Beetles have a relatively straight-forward engine for beginners (though I'm not quite sure what exactly that means). This fantasy also includes me having a garage.

This is all-to-familiar headspace for me. I was intimidated by the mention of changing oil and my immediate thought goes to taking apart a Volkswagon Beetle and rebuilding it in order to understand ... why I needed to change the oil in an entirely different car.

Why do I jump all the way to wanting to understand things from first principles? Maybe because this has been a successful way for me to learn programming as an adult, and I'm now pattern-matching into other complex systems. But, certainly, I should be able to productive with a complex system far in advance of knowing how to tear it apart and rebuild it.

Which leads to the following shower thought:

## The Six Levels of Interacting with Complex Systems

The six levels of interacting with a complex system are:

0. Non-use
1. Use
2. Monitor
3. Maintain
4. Repair
5. (Re)build

Yes, this is zero-indexed, obviously. Let's go through the levels them one-by-one, continuing our use of a car as the example. Note that each subsequent layer is a superset of the preceeding ones.

### Non-use

You can't use the system. You don't know how to drive the car.

### Use

You can use the primary purpose of the system. You know how to drive a car safely. You can go in reverse. You can fill it with gas.

### Monitor

You know how to observe secondary signals from the system. In our car, you know to occasionally review the dashboard for things like the engine light. You don't know what to do about these signals, but you know they are *a thing*.

### Maintain

You are comfortable enough with the monitoring signals to do routine maintence on the system. You add more washer fluid. You replace the battery. You add air to your tires at the gas station.

### Repair

You know how to fix sub-systems in the complex system. Not all the things, but the most important things (typically, components of the sub-systems that break most often). You can change a tire. You can replace brake pads. You can replace a broken headlight.

### (Re)build

You know how to tear apart the complex system completely and re-build it from scratch. You understand each sub-system, why it's there, and how to make them all work together. You can take apart the Volkswagon Beetle and put it back together.


## Other examples

> Sure, Charlie, that worked conveniently for your car example. But what about... other stuff?

Great question!

How about investing?

0. **Non-use**: Don't invest anything
1. **Use**: Invest some money and be able to check-in your returns
2. **Monitor**: Compare your returns with alternative investments
3. **Maintain**: Make slight adjustments based on these alternatives
4. **Repair**: Fix gaping holes or major problems in your investing strategy
5. **Re(build)**:Design a custom investment strategy for you (or anyone else)

Okay, admittedly `Repair` and `Rebuild` blended in a bit there. Let's try... using a desktop computer!

0. **Non-use**: Don't know how to use a computer. They're evil!
1. **Use**: Can use a computer to do stuff (go online, write a document, print it out, use a spreadsheet)
2. **Monitor**: Notice that your browser is slower than normal or that you are running out of hard drive space
3. **Maintain**: Empty your "trash bin" and clear your browser history
4. **Repair**: Remove that sketchy ad company browser extension from your parent's computer, reformat and restore your computer from backup
5. **Re(build)**Take apart computer, install new hard drive, install operation system on it
