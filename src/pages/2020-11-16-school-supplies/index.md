Somedays I remember that I have a loop pedal.

Those are the best sorts of days.

Somedays that leads to a new song.

### School Supplies

Hello, world, this is your premiere of SCHOOL SUPPLIES, the third single off my forthcoming EP: "Greetings From Buttzville, NJ":

The chords, for those interested (looking at you, The Grones) are:

```
Verse
G Bm Em C

Chorus
D G C

Outro(key change!)
A C#m F#m D
```

That's right! I pulled off my first key change. Thank you, Taylor Swift "Love Song" for the daily inspiration.

I'll leave the lyrics as an exercise for the reader.

#### Uncle Mike's Tips for Running a Zoom-Based Open Mic Night

Big thanks to Uncle Mike for organizing our second Zoom family open mic night. He runs a tight ship, mostly trying to prevent me from launching into a [Bullet Train to Merlin's Grave medley like at Popestock](/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave).

To paraphrase his tips:

* Each performer gets one song, of "normal song length" (so that means no Tubular Bells)
* Announce the order in advance
* Tune up your instrument when you're on deck or in the hole
* Don't worry about messing up, start over if you need to, this is fun. Music is the best!
* Change your zoom settings to "Original Sound"

This last one is key. Zoom does some "stuff" to make things sound "good" during boring work meetings that are boring. It's not optimized for fun singalongs that are fun. So, it's pretty much essential to [follow these steps](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound) when you're singing and strumming over Zoom, unless you're trying to incorporate cosmic waves of hollow nothingness into your jam. Maybe you are?

Oh, you should check out Uncle Mike's music podcast, [Tell You What! The Podcast](https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/). He interviews young musicians and bands on the run and it's fun and great and keeps you on your toes with new upcoming artists.

As Uncle Mike says, music is the best!
