I've pulled all my [Instagram #walkingman](https://instagram.com/whatrocks) photos into a handy little page. [Check it out](/walkingman).

So long as the Instagram API continues to play nice (no guarantees), then [this page](/walkingman) will stay up-to-date as my travels continue.

I'd love to learn more about who designs each of these little creatures for a given city or country. What's the decision process like? Are they meant to capture the spirit of the people in some way?

This is a coffee table book waiting to happen.
