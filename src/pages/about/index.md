Hello! My name is Charlie Harrington. I'm a computer programmer and writer living in San Francisco, California. I grew up in Red Bank, New Jersey, and it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.

I'm an engineering manager at [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com), building software to deliver fully-autonomous vehicles aka self-driving cars. You can see Cruise autonomous vehicles driving around San Francisco right now! Like *right now*, look outside!

I love [old computers](/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer), [books of all kinds](/library), [playing music](/school-supplies), and [the Great Outdoors](/rim-2-rim-2-rim). Here's a grainy photo of me playing *Let It Be* on banjo:

I'm also in the middle of ~~writing~~ ~~editing~~ re-editing a novel about robots. If you like robots and adventures and being a kid and summer reading and box fans, then this could be the book for you!
